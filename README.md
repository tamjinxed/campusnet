# CampusNet Frontend

This repository contains the frontend implementation of **CampusNet** built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**.

## Setup

Because this environment does not include `node_modules`, you will need to install dependencies before running the application:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Structure

- `pages/` – application pages for posts, events, groups, and the landing page.
- `components/` – shared React components including the navigation bar and reusable cards.
- `styles/` – global Tailwind styles.

Sample data is used to demonstrate the UI. Feel free to replace it with real API calls and functionality.
