# CampusNet Frontend

This repository contains the initial frontend implementation of **CampusNet** built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**.

## Setup

Because this environment does not include `node_modules`, you will need to install dependencies before running the application:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Structure

- `pages/` – application pages including placeholder pages for posts, events, and groups.
- `components/` – shared React components.
- `styles/` – global Tailwind styles.

This project provides a basic skeleton which can be expanded with additional pages and features.
